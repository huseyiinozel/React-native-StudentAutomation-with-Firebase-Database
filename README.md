# React-native-StudentAutomation-with-Firebase-Database

This is a simple student automation system project. I coded this project using React Native. Additionally, I used Firebase as the database.
To log into the system:
e-mail : admin@mail.com
password:123123


1)
Firstly, the login screen. On the login screen, you will need to enter your email and password.
If you enter them incorrectly, the application will log you out for security purposes. 
If you enter them correctly, you will be logged into the system. 
Additionally, once you log in once, even if you close the application, your session will be preserved,
and your session will not end unless you explicitly log out.
